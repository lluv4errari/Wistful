      <h2>Behind the Eye</h2>

      <p>They say a picture is worth 1000 words. What can these words be? Questions? Answers? Both? None? Are those words telling you a story behind the picture? Or rather, is it silent and letting you pick 1000 words?</p>

      <p>Biology is the study of life. It not only explains the living world around us, but also organizes it in order. From the organelles to our cells to taxonomic classifications, orderedness is deeply rooted in us. In relation, we as humans are wired to recognize patterns and structures around us, in other words, the order. Our ancestors did this not as a means to admire, but to survive.</p>

      <p>To organize, we must recognize the order. Going back to our ancestors, there had to be a point in time where we didn’t know the structural hierarchy of organisms. In order to create that hierarchy we had to recognize it, and give it purpose to create such a grouping (atoms, organisms, communities, etc). Because recognition and ordering is rooted into us as humans, the philosophy behind it questions what it really means to recognize something in the first place. This leads to the philosophy of recognition theory of meaning/purpose. What does it mean to recognize, especially when you’re looking at a picture? You see an image that is static in the fourth dimension (time), but displays the third dimension (the subject in the picture) on a second dimensional object (the object you are viewing the picture on). Unconsciously knowing it, you likely will notice patterns in these pictures. However, what is the purpose of the order you recognized? You’ll most likely answer with nothing. We don’t know the purpose. I haven’t explicitly stated; nor can you see in the picture what exactly the meaning of the piece is. If this is the case, then shouldn’t these pictures be deemed as “meaningless?” And if this logic proves to be true, doesn’t that mean there essentially is no order? Philosophers Husserl & Heidegger would ironically argue meaning isn’t inherent at all.</p>

      <p>While the “fallacies” recognized in this philosophical theory goes against our perception, we can only trust our senses that helped our very own ancestors survive, and confidently say that this is false. We know this because we see the order with our own eyes: walls, flooring, lighting, fencing, and more. It is architecturally structured in such a way to be pleasing to the naked eye, like architects intended for thousands of years to this day. Colosseum, Taj Mahal, Great Pyramids of Giza. These sites are known for their unique beauty. Architects engineered such structures to be attractions to not only the people that represent these places, but to those who visit as well. But how can we all agree that these sites are beautiful? What is something these three, and many more, structures have in common? The answer is more quantitative than you’d expect.</p>

      <p>The Golden Ratio is a mathematical concept that some believe holds the secret to beauty. The Golden Ratio is a ratio where 𝜙 equals approximately 1.618. In a lot of examples around us, the spiral of this ratio is apparent, such as natural examples like seashells, sunflowers, honeycomb, etc. Others are man made, like those discussed previously. Despite beauty being subjective, this ratio quantitatively portrays the human attraction towards objects. This ratio is strict and consistent, meaning this, too, can be a form of structure we may unconsciously find around us. When we try to find beauty, we may try to find ratios that are close to 𝜙. Some may be obvious, others discreet. Understanding the mathematical Golden Ratio may make you wonder whether the ratio is present in these photos, making you curious about it. Maybe it could be an explanation of why you are unable to take your eyes off.</p>

      <p>If 1.618 is the ratio we yearn for in terms of beauty, you might notice that we’ll perceive things in different ways, more specifically, these photos. Most likely, your opinion on these photos will be different and possibly opposing someone else's views. Since this is true, maybe this ratio isn’t universal after all. Furthermore, if it is a sensational feeling that has an effect on perception, how come the sensory input I process is different from what you process, even though we’re looking at the same picture? Because perceptions differ, our brains may challenge the universality of mathematical principles, including the Golden Ratio. Reading into it, our mind might rather deceive us and the “theory” of science. Essentially, the brain is sparring itself and mathematics (which is also created by us, so now we’re stuck in a loop).</p>

      <p>To tie it all in, the patterns we see in these pictures, the comfort we feel, the feeling of being unable to look away, the meaning we feel but cannot fully articulate – these are just a few senses to be explored within, in relation to the conceptual ideologies I have traced back to. Rather than challenging the notion of deception, we can paint conclusions for ourselves and find our own meaning to these photos, and create a new pathway instead of going back to ideas in a loop. After all, isn’t that what our brains are wired to do regardless? Thus we are unable to ever stray away from being ourselves, no matter how much we ponder upon it. That leads you to wonder… if everyone is wired to do this, then the idea of perception being different, is now changed. Perhaps perception differs in content but not in mechanism. While interpretations vary person to person, the underlying human impulse to search for meaning may be universal.</p>

      <p>In regards to photography, it truly is fascinating how concepts such as math and philosophy can tie in so deeply with photography, particularly in this art style. It makes you question and reflect on your own knowledge, despite the limited subjects presented to you in the photograph.</p>
